# A Problem Analysis

## Input:
1. capacity_in_gallon: The fuel tank capacity in gallons (a double value).
 The user provides this input when prompted by the program.
   
2. mile_in_Pergallon: The number of miles the automobile can travel per gallon of fuel (a double value).
   The user provides this input when prompted by the program.

## Process:
Step 1: Multiply the fuel tank capacity (in gallons) by the miles the automobile can drive per gallon.
 This calculation provides the total number of miles the automobile can drive without refueling.
   Formula
   total_mile = capacity_in_gallon * mile_in_Pergallon
## Output:
total_mile: The total number of miles the automobile can drive without refueling, which is printed as output.
   The program displays this result to the user in the format:
    The automobile can be driven <total_mile> miles without refueling
