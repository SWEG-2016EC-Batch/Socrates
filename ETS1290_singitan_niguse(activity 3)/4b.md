## a
Start
Initialize rows as an integer
Output "Enter the number of rows for the triangle:"
Input the value for rows
Loop through each row i from 1 to rows 6. Loop through each space from 1 to rows - i 7. Output two spaces 8. Loop through each number j from 1 to i 9. Output j followed by a space 10. Move to a new line
End loop
End loop
End
## b
Start
Declare rows as an integer
Output "Enter the number of rows for the triangle:"
Input the value for rows
For each row i from 1 to rows do the following: 6. For each space from 1 to rows - i do the following: 7. Output two spaces 8. For each number j from 1 to i do the following: 9. Output j followed by a space 10. Move to a new line
End loop
End loop
End
## c
Start
Declare rows as an integer
Output "Enter the number of rows for the triangle:"
Input the value for rows
For each row i from 1 to rows do the following: 6. For each space from 1 to rows - i do the following: 7. Output two spaces 8. For each number j from 1 to i do the following: 9. Output j followed by a space 10. Move to a new line

## full_pyramid
Start
Declare variables: space, rows
Input the number of rows (rows)
Loop from i = 1 to rows a. Initialize k = 0 b. Loop from space = 1 to rows - i - Print two spaces c. Initialize k = 0 d. While k is not equal to 2*i - 1 - Print an asterisk followed by a space - Increment k e. Move to the next line
End.
