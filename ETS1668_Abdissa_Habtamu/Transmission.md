Problem Analysis

The program calculates the time required to transmit a file of a given size over a network with a fixed transmission rate (960 bytes per second). The result is displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

Input:

1. File size in bytes (integer).



Process:

1. Calculate the total transmission time in seconds:



time = file_size\transmission_rate

Days = total seconds รท 86400

Hours = remaining seconds รท 3600

Minutes = remaining seconds รท 60

Remaining seconds = remaining seconds % 60.


Output:

The time required to transmit the file in the format:

it takes <days> day:<hours> hour:<minutes> minute:<seconds> second


---

Pseudo-code

1. Start


2. Declare variables: days, hours, minutes, seconds, file_size, time, and transmission_rate = 960.


3. Prompt the user to input the file size in bytes.


4. Read file_size.


5. Calculate total transmission time:

time = file_size / transmission_rate



6. Compute the breakdown of time:

days = time / 86400

time = time % 86400

hours = time / 3600

time = time % 3600

minutes = time / 60

seconds = time % 60



7. Display the results in the format <days> day:<hours> hour:<minutes> minute:<seconds> second.


8. End
