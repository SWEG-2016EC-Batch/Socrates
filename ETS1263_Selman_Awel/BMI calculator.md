# problem analysis
1. INPUT: Two real numbers Weight(W) in kilogram and Height(H) in meters  
2. OUTPUT:  
    a. Body mass index, BMI  
    b. under weight, normal, and obese
3. OPERATION:  
    a. Reading the two numbers W and H  
    b. calculate BMI= W/H*H  
    c. display BMI  
    d. checking if the BMI fullfills certain parameters.  
    Example: Is BMI less than 18.5 or  
             Is BMI >=18.5 and BMI< 25 or  
             IS BMI >25.  
    e. Displaying under weight, normal, or overweight according to the above circumstances.  
# pseudocode 
step1: Start  
step2: Read height H in meters  
step3: Read weight W in kilograms  
step4: Calculate BMI as  
                    BMI= W/H*H  
step5:
